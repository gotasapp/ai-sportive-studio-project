## 🚧 **REMAINING TASKS - PRIORITIZED ROADMAP**

### 🔥 **CRITICAL PRIORITY - FOR PRODUCTION LAUNCH**

#### **1. DEPLOYMENT ISSUES (BLOCKING PRODUCTION)**
```bash
Issues identified in documentation:
❌ Hardcoded localhost URLs in production build
❌ CORS errors between frontend/backend services  
❌ Environment variables not properly configured
❌ Python APIs not deployed to cloud infrastructure
❌ Build failures due to missing dependencies
```

**Required Actions:**
- Configure all environment variables for production
- Deploy Python FastAPI services to Render/Railway
- Replace hardcoded localhost with environment variables
- Set up proper CORS policies
- Test complete end-to-end flow in staging

#### **2. LOADING EXPERIENCE (UX CRITICAL)**
```typescript
// Missing: Themed loading videos during generation
interface LoadingVideos {
  jersey: "jersey-drawing-animation.mp4"    // ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
  stadium: "stadium-construction.mp4"       // ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED  
  badge: "badge-formation.mp4"              // ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
  duration: "3-5 seconds each"
  style: "Professional looping animations"
